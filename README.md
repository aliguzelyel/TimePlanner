# TimePlanner

TimePlanner finds the available times for meet-ups in a group

Input how many people will there be. Should be 2n people (2, 4, 6 ..)

Write the first person's available times,  
  ex. the person is available from 5 to 10; input 5, press enter, input 10. If you want to add another time do the same. When you are done with the first person, input -1.
  
Now write the second person's available times and then the third and so on...  

When you are done with every person, the program will tell you the best time for the meet-up with how many people can attend at that time. 

The best time is chosen as the time the most people can attend at.

You can also see the other good times by looking at the array that tells you how many people can attend at each hour.

*The program works only with user input right now, reading from a file will be implemented later.
